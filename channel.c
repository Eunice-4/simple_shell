Please note that these are just the basic structures. 
You’ll need to implement the functions like read_line(), split_line(), 
and execute() according to your project requirements. 
Also, remember to handle errors and edge cases appropriately.

main.c: This is the entry point of your program. You should initialize your shell here, enter the shell loop, and then clean up and exit when done.

shell_loop.c: This is where the main loop of your shell will be. You should print a prompt, read a line of input, parse the line into arguments, execute the command, and then repeat.

parser.c: This is where you’ll parse the input line into a list of arguments. You can use functions like strtok to split the string into tokens.

builtin.c: This is where you’ll handle built-in commands. You should check if the command is a built-in, and if so, execute it.

understanding the basics of how a shell works and then implementing those functionalities in your program. Here’s a basic outline of the steps you might follow:

Read Input: The shell needs to read input from the user. This is usually done in a loop, often called the main loop or REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop).

Parse Input: The input string needs to be parsed into a command and its arguments. This typically involves tokenizing the string (splitting it into pieces) based on spaces, and treating the first token as the command and the remaining tokens as the arguments.

Execute Commands: The shell then needs to execute the command with its arguments. This is usually done by forking the current process to create a new one, and then using the exec function to replace the new process with the command the user wants to run.

Built-in Commands: The shell should also have some built-in commands that it handles itself, such as cd, exit, and history. These commands need to be handled separately before trying to execute commands as external programs.

Prompt: The shell should display a prompt to the user when it’s ready to accept input. This is usually a simple string like $  or > , but it could also include other information like the current directory or user name.

Error Handling: The shell should appropriately handle errors, such as command not found or permission denied, and display a helpful error message to the user.

Here’s a very basic example of what a shell program might look like in C:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char* line = NULL;
    size_t len = 0;
    ssize_t read;

    while (1) {
        printf("> ");
        read = getline(&line, &len, stdin);
        if (read == -1) {
            break;
        }
        system(line);
    }

    free(line);
    return 0;
}

This program reads a line of input from the user, and then uses the system function to execute the line as a command. 
It’s a very simple shell and doesn’t include many of the features you’d find in a full shell like bash, but it’s a starting point.

Imagine you’re playing with your toy blocks. Each block is a piece of code. Now, we’re going to build a castle, which is our “Simple Shell” project.

The Entrance (main function): This is where we start. It’s like the door to our castle. We need to make sure it’s strong and secure. In code, this is our main function. It’s the starting point of our program.
int main(void)
{
    /* code */
    return (0);
}

The Walls (shell loop): These are the main parts of our castle. They keep everything inside safe. In our shell, this is the loop that keeps running, waiting for commands.
while (1)
{
    /* code */
}

The Rooms (functions): These are the different parts of our castle, like the kitchen, the living room, etc. In our shell, these are the different functions that do specific tasks, like reading input, executing commands, etc.
void read_command(void)
{
    /* code */
}

void execute_command(void)
{
    /* code */
}

The Decorations (error handling): These make our castle look nice and handle problems. In our shell, this is the error handling code that makes sure everything runs smoothly.
if (error)
{
    /* handle error */
}

And that’s it! We’ve built our castle (or “Simple Shell”). Remember, each block (or piece of code) is important and has a specific job. And just like building a castle
